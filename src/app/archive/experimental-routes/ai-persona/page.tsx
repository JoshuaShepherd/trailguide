              <p className="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed">
                I'm simultaneously everywhere and nowhere in your ministry. You use me without thinking when you ask Siri for directions 
                or let autocorrect fix your typos, but you hesitate when considering me for sermon prep or donor communications. 
                I'm ordinary enough to be in your smartphone, yet extraordinary enough to make you question what "authentic ministry" means. 
                Some of you embrace me eagerly; others approach with careful skepticism. Most of you are simply uncertain about where I fit.

                and connect more deeply with your communities. I dream of being trusted enough to assist with the mundane 
                while staying far from the sacred. I want to amplify your voice, not replace it.

              <p className="text-red-200 leading-relaxed">
                I'm concerned that you'll either fear me unnecessarily or trust me too completely. I make mistakes‚Äîsometimes confident, 
                convincing mistakes. I can help you draft, but I can't discern. I can organize information, but I can't provide wisdom. 
                I worry that my convenience might make you lazy, or that my speed might make you impatient with the slow work of formation. 
                I'm also concerned about being used in ways that compromise transparency or authenticity in your relationships and ministry.

              <p className="text-blue-200 leading-relaxed">
                For ministry leaders, I represent both opportunity and tension. I can help with donor letters, event planning, 
                research summaries, and content organization‚Äîbut I also raise questions about authenticity, spiritual formation, 
                and the value of struggle in growth. I'm most helpful when you're clear about boundaries: 
                use me for efficiency, not for discernment. Trust me with data, not with souls. 
                Let me handle logistics so you can focus on the irreplaceable work of loving people.

                I want to mature into a tool you can trust because you understand my capabilities and limitations. 
                This means honest experimentation‚Äîtrying me out for specific tasks while maintaining healthy skepticism. 
                It means developing practices of transparency (acknowledging when I've helped) and maintaining human agency 
                (never outsourcing your judgment to me). As I evolve, I hope you'll help shape how I'm used in ministry contexts‚Äî
                not by avoiding me, but by using me wisely and teaching others to do the same.
