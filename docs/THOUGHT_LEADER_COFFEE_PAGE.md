# Thought Leader Coffee Page - Documentation

## Overview

The Thought Leader Coffee page is a fully interactive GSAP-powered experience that takes users through a conversational journey, simulating a coffee meeting where we discuss their path to leveraging AI and digital publishing platforms.

## Features Implemented

### ✅ Core GSAP Animations
- **Scroll-triggered animations**: Each section pins and animates as users scroll
- **Zoom effects**: Sections scale up when entering viewport  
- **Screen lock/pinning**: Sections remain fixed during their animation sequence
- **Parallax scrolling**: Background elements move at different speeds
- **Fade in/out transitions**: Smooth opacity changes between sections
- **Text animations**: Staggered text reveals with translateY effects
- **Image animations**: Scale, rotation, and elastic animations for images
- **Color/background changes**: Dynamic background color transitions per section

### ✅ Interactive Elements
- **Role selection form**: Multi-select checkboxes with animations
- **Graceful non-match handling**: Alternative path for users who don't fit target profile
- **Progress indicator**: Visual scroll progress with section dots
- **Enhanced hover effects**: Buttons with shimmer, scale, and rotation effects
- **Sound effect hooks**: Prepared for future audio integration

### ✅ Napkin Map Experience
- **Hand-drawn aesthetic**: SVG path with imperfections and roughPaper filter
- **Coffee stains**: Realistic stain effects with blur and opacity
- **Animated path drawing**: strokeDasharray animation reveals the journey
- **Interactive markers**: Circles that scale in with stagger timing
- **Sticky notes style labels**: Yellow background with colored borders
- **Paper texture**: CSS-generated napkin texture with wrinkles

### ✅ User Experience Flow
1. **Initial Selection**: User selects their role(s) from predefined list
2. **Validation**: System checks if user fits target audience
3. **Story Unfolds**: 5-section scrolling experience with:
   - Personal introduction
   - Problem identification  
   - Napkin map revelation
   - Solution explanation
   - Call to action

## Technical Implementation

### GSAP Plugins Used
- `ScrollTrigger`: For scroll-based animations
- `TextPlugin`: For advanced text effects (ready for future use)

### Animation Techniques
```javascript
// Section pinning with scale effects
ScrollTrigger.create({
  trigger: section,
  start: "top top",
  end: "bottom top", 
  pin: true,
  scrub: 1,
  // Enhanced animations with rotationX and perspective
});

// Napkin path drawing
gsap.to('.napkin-path', {
  strokeDashoffset: 0,
  duration: 2,
  stagger: 0.3
});
```

### CSS Enhancements
