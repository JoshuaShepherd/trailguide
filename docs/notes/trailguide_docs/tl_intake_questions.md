# TrailGuide Thought Leader Intake Process
> **Complete intake system for custom publishing platform builds**

## Process Overview

The TrailGuide intake process transforms a thought leader from initial inquiry to platform launch in **3-4 weeks**. This comprehensive system ensures we build not just a website, but a strategic digital presence that amplifies their voice, grows their audience, and generates sustainable revenue.

### Process Philosophy
- **Story-first**: We understand the leader's journey before building tools
- **Evidence-based**: We research existing content and audience patterns
- **Prototype-driven**: We show, don't just tell
- **Launch-ready**: Every platform launches with content, not empty templates
