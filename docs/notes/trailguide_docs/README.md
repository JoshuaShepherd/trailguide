4. **Transformation** (Summit Ascent)
5. **Wisdom** (Summit)

- **TrailHikes**: Cohort-based workshops and training programs
- **Publishing Platforms**: Custom React/Next.js sites for thought leaders
- **TrailGuide Consulting**: White-glove AI implementation services

## Documentation Philosophy

This documentation system follows TrailGuide's core principles:
- **Clarity over complexity** - Each document focuses on one main topic
- **Story-driven content** - Real examples and case studies throughout
- **Practical orientation** - Actionable insights and next steps
- **Visual organization** - Clean markdown formatting with clear hierarchies

## Usage Guidelines

### For New Team Members
Start with documents 1-4 to understand the foundation, then move to your role-specific documents.

### For Stakeholders
Review documents 1, 3, and 7 for your profile, plus any topic-specific documents.

### For Content Creation
Use document 9 (Content Strategy) as your guide, and reference the Brand Identity (document 8) for voice and style.

### For Development
Reference document 6 (TrailMap) for the technical framework and user journey mapping.

## Maintenance Notes

- All documents preserve the complete content from the original full_docs.md
- Updates should maintain the focused, single-topic approach of each document
- Cross-references between documents should use relative links
- The Table of Contents (document 00) should be updated when new documents are added
