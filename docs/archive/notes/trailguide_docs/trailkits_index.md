# Nonprofit TrailKits — Product Spec (Agentic, Full-Stack, UX-First)

> **Stack assumptions:** Next.js/React + Tailwind + shadcn/ui; Supabase (auth/DB); Vercel (hosting); Stripe (if payments); Resend/Postmark (email); Mux/Vimeo (video); OpenAI **Agents SDK** for orchestrated, tool-using agents.  
> **Design system:** Consistent shell across TrailKits (left nav, top KPIs bar, command palette ⌘K, agent console, alerts drawer, audit log).  
> **Agent roles (reused across kits):**  
> - **Orchestrator** (routes intents, enforces guardrails, calls other agents/tools)  
> - **Researcher** (finds info, summarizes)  
> - **Writer** (drafts outreach, briefs, reports using TipTap blocks)  
> - **Analyst** (segments data, builds cohorts, forecasts)  
> - **Ops** (creates tasks, updates records, schedules, posts to calendar/Slack)  
> - **QA/Compliance** (checks tone, consent, DEI/ethics, opt-in status)  

All TrailKits share UX primitives:

- **Top bar KPIs:** 4–6 real-time tiles; “Change vs last 30 days”; quick filters (Program, Campaign, Location).  
- **Primary CTA:** “New…” (task, campaign, event) + “Ask the Guide” (agent prompt).  
- **Main Canvas:** Switches between **Dashboard / Work / Data / Messages / Insights / Settings** tabs.  
- **Right Drawer:** “Agent Console” (chat + recent runs + tools used + rollback).  
- **Bottom Bar:** “Playbooks” (saved automations/prompt-chains) + **Audit Log** (who/what/when).

## Shared UX Patterns (All TrailKits)

- **Ethics & AI Guardrails:** tone/consent/privacy checks, policy links, override + justification flow.  
- **Notification Center:** digestable alerts (daily/weekly), Slack/email hooks.

## Implementation Notes

- **Data model:** Shared core tables (`contacts`, `orgs`, `tasks`, `files`, `events`, `transactions`) with kit-specific tables (`donations`, `grants`, `volunteers`, `program_outcomes`, etc.).  
- **Agents SDK:** One **Orchestrator** per kit with specialized tools; shared Writer/QA agents; tool adapters wrap external APIs with strict schemas & rate limits.  
- **Observability:** Log all tool invocations, durations, errors; add “retry / resume run” controls.  
- **Performance:** Server components for heavy queries; optimistic UI for task updates; background jobs for long-running agent tasks.
