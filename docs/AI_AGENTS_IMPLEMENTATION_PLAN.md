# TrailGuide AI Agents Implementation Plan

## Vendor Documentation Integration

### 1. Vendor File Organization ✅

The vendor files are already properly organized in `/vendor/` and should remain as documentation/reference only:

```
vendor/
├── openai-agents-js-main/          # Core OpenAI Agents SDK
├── openai-realtime-agents-main/    # Realtime voice agents  
├── openai-realtime-api-beta-main/  # Realtime API
└── supabase/                       # Database integration
```

**Strategy**: Keep these as read-only documentation and examples. Do NOT import directly from vendor/ in our codebase.

### 2. Agent SDK Implementation Plan

Based on the comprehensive vendor documentation review, here's our implementation strategy:

## Core Agent Architecture for TrailGuide

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup (Week 1)

**Install Dependencies**
```bash
npm install @openai/agents @openai/agents-core zod@3
```

**Create Agent Infrastructure**
```
src/
├── agents/
│   ├── core/
│   │   ├── BaseAgent.ts          # TrailGuide agent base class
│   │   ├── Runner.ts             # Custom runner with tracing
│   │   └── tools/                # Shared tools library
│   ├── nonprofit/
│   │   ├── FundraisingAgent.ts   # Fundraising TrailKit agent
│   │   ├── AdminAgent.ts         # Admin TrailKit agent
│   │   └── ExecutiveAgent.ts     # Executive dashboard agent
│   ├── thought-leader/
│   │   ├── PublishingAgent.ts    # Content creation agent
│   │   ├── AudienceAgent.ts      # Audience growth agent
│   │   └── StrategyAgent.ts      # Business strategy agent
│   └── shared/
│       ├── ResearchAgent.ts      # Web research capabilities
│       ├── AnalyticsAgent.ts     # Data analysis agent
│       └── WritingAgent.ts       # Content writing agent
```

- Integration: Both nonprofit and thought leader use cases

**Handoff Workflows**
- Nonprofit: Executive → Fundraising → Communications agents
- Thought Leader: Strategy → Publishing → Audience agents
- Cross-domain: Research → Writing → Publishing chains

## Technical Implementation Details

### 1. Agent Configuration

```typescript
// Base TrailGuide Agent
export class TrailGuideAgent extends Agent {
  constructor(config: TrailGuideAgentConfig) {
    super({
      ...config,
      // TrailGuide-specific defaults
      model: 'gpt-4o',
      traceMetadata: {
        organization: 'trailguide',
        version: '1.0.0'
      }
    });
  }
}
```

### 2. Custom Tools Library

Based on vendor examples, create TrailGuide-specific tools:

```typescript
// Nonprofit tools
export const grantDatabaseTool = tool({
  name: 'search_grants',
  description: 'Search grant databases for opportunities',
  parameters: z.object({
    focus_area: z.string(),
    amount_range: z.string(),
    deadline_range: z.string()
  }),
  execute: async (input) => {
    // Implementation for grant database search
  }
});

// Thought leader tools  
export const contentOptimizationTool = tool({
  name: 'optimize_content',
  description: 'Optimize content for SEO and engagement',
  parameters: z.object({
    content: z.string(),
    target_audience: z.string(),
    platform: z.string()
  }),
  execute: async (input) => {
    // Implementation for content optimization
  }
});
```

### 3. Streaming Integration

Implement streaming responses for real-time TrailKit interactions:

```typescript
// API route example: /api/agents/nonprofit/fundraising
export async function POST(req: NextRequest) {
  const { messages, trailkit_type } = await req.json();
  
  const agent = getTrailKitAgent(trailkit_type);
  const runner = new Runner({
    groupId: `trailkit_${trailkit_type}`,
    streaming: true
  });
  
  // Stream responses back to TrailKit dashboard
  return new Response(/* streaming response */);
}
```

### 4. Integration Points

**TrailKit Dashboards**
- Embed agent chat interfaces directly in each TrailKit
- Real-time suggestions and automation
- Background processing for data analysis

**Publishing Platforms**  
- AI writing assistants embedded in content editors
- Automated content optimization and scheduling
- Audience engagement analysis and recommendations

**Shared Components**
- Universal research and analysis capabilities
- Cross-platform content adaptation
- Performance tracking and optimization

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- Agent response time < 2 seconds for simple queries
- 95% uptime for agent services
- Successful handoffs between agents
- Streaming response reliability

### Business Metrics
- Increased TrailKit engagement (time spent, features used)
- Improved content publishing frequency for thought leaders
- Enhanced user satisfaction scores
- Reduced time-to-value for new users

## Next Steps

1. **Week 1**: Set up basic agent infrastructure and first nonprofit agent
2. **Week 2**: Implement fundraising and executive agents with TrailKit integration
3. **Week 3**: Build thought leader publishing and audience agents
4. **Week 4**: Create multi-agent workflows and handoff systems
5. **Week 5**: Testing, optimization, and production deployment

This plan leverages the comprehensive OpenAI Agents SDK while building TrailGuide-specific functionality that directly serves our nonprofit and thought leader audiences.
