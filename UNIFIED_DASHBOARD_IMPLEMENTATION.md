## 🔧 Usage

### Basic Implementation
```tsx
import { UnifiedShell } from '@/components/dashboard';
import { getKitBySlug } from '@/kits';

export default function KitPage({ params }) {
  const kit = getKitBySlug(params.kit);
  
  return (
    <UnifiedShell 
      kit={kit}
      orgContext={{
        id: 'org-123',
        name: 'Demo Organization', 
        role: 'admin'

```

### Custom Content
```tsx
<UnifiedShell kit={kit}>
  {/* Custom dashboard content */}
  <div className="space-y-6">
    <CustomKitComponent />
    <AnotherComponent />
  </div>
</UnifiedShell>
```

### Navigation Configuration
```tsx
import { buildNavigationForKit } from '@/components/dashboard';

const kitModules = buildNavigationForKit(kit);
// Automatically generates kit-specific navigation
```
