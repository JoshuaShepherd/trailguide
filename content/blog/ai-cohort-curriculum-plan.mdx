Some learning happens through consuming content. Some happens through doing. But the deepest learning—the kind that changes how you see yourself and your work in the world—happens in the space between people who are brave enough to learn together. This is our blueprint for creating that space.

## The Philosophy: Beyond Skills to Transformation

**This isn't a course about AI tools. It's a laboratory for discovering how human wisdom and artificial intelligence can dance together in service of work that matters.**

We're eating our own dog food—using the very principles we teach about transformative content to create transformative learning experiences. Every session is both curriculum and case study, both learning and research.

**The Kansas Leadership Center approach:** Start with adaptive challenges, learn through real work, develop capabilities that outlast any single tool or technique.

**The Rick Rubin element:** Trust the process, create space for emergence, and remember that the most profound insights often come sideways, when we're not forcing them.

## The Container: Sacred Space for Dangerous Learning

### **Physical Environment**
- **Location:** Rotating homes/spaces that feel personal, not institutional
- **Setup:** Comfortable seating in a circle, not classroom-style rows
- **Food:** Real meals together—not coffee and pastries, but nourishment that says "we're here for the long haul"
- **Technology:** Minimal during discussions, intentional when used
- **Timing:** 3-hour sessions (10am-1pm), biweekly, Saturdays

### **Relational Environment**
- **Size:** 8-12 participants maximum (small enough for deep conversation)
- **Commitment:** Full 6-month journey—no dropping in and out
- **Confidentiality:** What's shared here, stays here
- **Vulnerability:** We model the discomfort of not knowing, of being beginners
- **Curiosity:** Questions matter more than answers

## The Curriculum Arc: Six Months, Twelve Sessions
