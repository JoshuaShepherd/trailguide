######

Execute the following prompt but do so in the following way.

Instead of this being the website of a particular thought leader such as the ones in my audience, you will essentially be creating a full thought leader website example template that simultaneously teaches through its own form and copy what a thought leader website should be according to best practices.

That is, you will make it clear what this is, and you will make it clearly a template for showcasing the work we do for thought leaders.

MASTER PROMPT — Build Full-Stack Expert Publisher Example

We are creating a fully functional, live example of our Expert Publisher platform—a demo site that shows prospective users exactly what their full digital presence, content engine, and monetization stack will look like when they launch with us.

Purpose

This isn’t just a marketing site—it’s an interactive showroom:
	•	Demonstrates the end-to-end capabilities of our platform.
	•	Shows how each feature benefits the user’s goals (building an audience, monetizing, scaling).
	•	Educates the user by example: the site itself is a model of best practices.

This build must feel real—with seeded content, working flows, and integrated AI-driven tooling.

⸻

Scope

The platform includes everything from A–M in our breakdown:
