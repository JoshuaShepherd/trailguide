I currently have no github repo set up for this project and want it fully deployed.

The local slug is trailguide/

Also it needs to be deployed to the GitHub account JoshuaShepherd, though I may be signed into my work account right now, so be sure.

Otherwise, fully deploy after ensuring that it passes all build errors and that you believe it is likely to be fully ready to go.
