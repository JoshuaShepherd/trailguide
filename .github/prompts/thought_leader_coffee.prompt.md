Do a page called thought-leader-coffee/page.tsx.

This is the one that needs to pull of the kind of GSAP experience that allows a user to scroll through a series of images and text that tell a story.

In this case, the story we're telling is what our conversation might be like if I had coffee with:

Well let's just start.

Page View 1:

Select all that are true for you.

I am:

A thought leader
Pastor
Writer
Coach
Consultant
Speaker
Entrepreneur
Ministry Leader
Movement Leader
Non-Profit Leader
Other: ___________

And if they're not one of these, we gracefully handle the fact that they might not need to have this conversation.

But if they are...

Or maybe it should be are you any of these since we're just trying to make sure they fit the profile.

In any event, the gist is that once they select this the next view is this scrolly experience in which I reply.

And pretty early on I present a napkin map that charts the path for thought leaders to the redemptive use of AI & Digital Publishing Platforms to share their content, find and connect with their audience, and keep 90% of everything they make.

Then we scroll through a series of images and text that tell the story of how this works.

But as you can see it's functioning kind of like the funnel, but I'm also wanting the GSAP to capture their attention.

So do the full GSaP experience and we'll build around it. The zoom/the screen lock/ the pinning/ the parallax/ the scroll trigger/ the fade in fade out/ the text animations/ the image animations/ the transitions/ the color changes/ the background changes/ the sound effects/ the music/ the voiceover.

And then I'll come back in and field content.

And at the outset of doing this prompt can you please give me 5 starter prompts for the map napkin image I can try to play around with visually.

I like that image for us. Maps on the back of pages and napkins.
